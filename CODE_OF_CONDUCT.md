# Runme Community Code of Conduct

### Guidelines for Participation

We strive to create a welcoming and diverse space for all tech enthusiasts.

Be your best self. Engage with others in the community with respect and compassion. Differences of opinion are welcome, but only when shared in a respectful, non-personal manner.

Please limit vague criticism. Negative comments that aren't constructive can harm the community's morale. Offer feedback that is thoughtful and actionable. If you're passionate about improving something, we encourage you to get involved by contributing via pull requests.

We do not tolerate abusive behavior such as insults, spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting, or harassment. Sexual language, inappropriate imagery, and unwanted advances are strictly prohibited. Private harassment is equally unacceptable.

We aim to avoid [subtle biases](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules), which are small actions that can make others feel uncomfortable. If you notice one, feel free to gently bring it up with the person, either in public or privately, or ask a moderator to step in. Mistakenly saying something biased is common, forgivable, and not an immediate cause for banning.

### Moderation Process

If you believe moderation is needed, please contact a [`maintainer`](MAINTAINERS.md) directly.

Moderators will issue a warning to users who violate the guidelines. A second offense leads to a temporary ban, while a third results in a permanent ban. Moderators may lift bans for users who demonstrate genuine remorse or issue immediate bans for severe misconduct. If you believe a ban is unjustified, you may appeal by emailing adam@stateful.com.
