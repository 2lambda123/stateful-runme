# rdme

Execute code snippets directly from Markdown files, defaulting to local `README.md`.

rdme extracts all code snippets defined in code blocks and allows to explore and execute them.

You can execute commands from a different directory using a `--chdir` flag.
To select a different file than `README.md`, use `--filename`.

## Installation

If you have Go developer tools installed, you can install it with `go install`:

```sh
