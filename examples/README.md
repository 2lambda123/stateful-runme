# Examples

## Shell

This is a basic snippet with shell command:

```sh
$ echo "Hello, rdme!"
```

It can contain multiple lines too:

```sh
$ echo "1"
$ echo "2"
$ echo "3"
```

Also, the dollar sign is not needed:

```sh
echo "Hello, rdme! Again!"
```

## Go

It can also execute a snippet of Go code:

```go
package main

import (
    "fmt"
)

func main() {
    fmt.Println("Hello from Go, rdme!")
}
```
